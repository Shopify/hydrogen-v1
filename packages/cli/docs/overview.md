## `@shopify/hydrogen-cli`

The `hydrogen/cli` package provides interactive project scaffolding for Hydrogen apps and other useful commands to help you build on `@shopify/hydrogen`.

> Note:
> The CLI doesn't currently generate the [Demo Store template](/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/getting-started). Run `npx create-hydrogen-app` to scaffold a new project with the Demo Store template. To contribute to the Demo Store template, update the [template files](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/main/examples/template-hydrogen-default).
