- Use hashes as client component ids instead of absolute paths
- Transition away from deprecated currency selector in favor of country selector
- Simplify Helmet usage and make it compatible with RSC
- The `Seo.client` component has been moved from `src/components` to `@shopify/hydrogen`. The props of the `Seo.client` component also changed to always take in `type` and `data`.

- Prevent client components from being cached during development
- Backticks in HTML break RSC hydration.

### Removed

- <CartLineSelectedOptions /> and <CartLineAttributes /> components. These components used the ‚Äúfunction-as-a-child‚Äù pattern which doesn‚Äôt allow the `children` prop to be serialized, preventing them from being rendered within Server components.

_Migration_

The functionality provided by these components can be replicated using the `useCartLine()` hook instead.

_Example_

```tsx
// Before
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <CartLineSelectedOptions as="ul" className="text-xs space-y-1">
        {({name, value}) => (
          <>
            {name}: {value}
          </>
        )}
      </CartLineSelectedOptions>
      <CartLineAttributes as="ul" className="text-sm space-y-1">
        {({key, value}) => (
          <>
            {key}: {value}
          </>
        )}
      </CartLineAttributes>
    </>
  );
}

// After
function SomeComponent() {
  const {merchandise} = useCartLine();

  return (
    <>
      <ul className="text-xs space-y-1">
        {merchandise.selectedOptions.map(({name, value}) => (
          <li key={name}>
            {name}: {value}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
