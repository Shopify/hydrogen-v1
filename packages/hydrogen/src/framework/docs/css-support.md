Hydrogen's quick start environment is styled using the Tailwind CSS utility library [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This guide describes the CSS support that's built into Hydrogen apps and how you can customize your app's styles.

## How it works

You can build with Tailwind's library or use other methods of styling like vanilla CSS files or a third-party CSS-in-JS framework. Hydrogen is powered by Vite, which natively supports several different [methods of CSS injection](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css).

> Note:
> Make sure to import your stylesheets from a `*.client.jsx` component, or from your client entrypoint at `src/entry-client.jsx`.

## Remove Tailwind

If you don't want to build with Tailwind's library and instead want to write your own CSS, then you can remove Tailwind:

1. Delete all the code in `src/index.css`.
2. Remove Tailwind from `package.json`.
3. Remove Tailwind from `postcss.config.js`.
4. Run the following commands:

   {% codeblock file, filename: 'Terminal' %}

   ```bash?filename: 'Terminal', title: 'yarn'
   # Switch to your app's directory
   cd <directory>
   # Install dependencies for your project
   yarn install
   # Start the development server
   yarn dev
   ```

   ```bash?filename: 'Terminal', title: 'npm'
   # Switch to your app's directory
   cd <directory>
   # Install dependencies for your project
   npm i --legacy-peer-deps
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```

   {% endcodeblock %}

## Known issues with server-side rendering (SSR)

Some CSS-in-JS frameworks (for example, CSS Modules) might not work properly with SSR. Shopify is investigating how to support these frameworks in connection with React server components and streaming SSR.
