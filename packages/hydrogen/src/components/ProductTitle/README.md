The `ProductTitle` component renders a `span` element (or the type of
HTML element specified by the `as` prop) with the product's [`title`](/api/storefront/reference/products/product).
It must be a descendent of the `ProductProvider` component.

## Example code

```tsx
import {ProductTitle, ProductProvider} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

export function Product({product}) {
  return (
    <ProductProvider value={product}>
      <ProductTitle />
    </ProductProvider>
  );
}
```

## Alias

The `ProductTitle` component is aliased by the `Product.Title` component. You can use whichever component you prefer.

## Component type

The `ProductTitle` component is a client component, which means that it renders on the client. For more information about component types, refer to [React Server Components](/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/react-server-components).
