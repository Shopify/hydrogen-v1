The `RawHtml` component renders an HTML string as HTML DOM elements. This should be used for
displaying rich text-like descriptions associated with a product.

This component uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. In general, setting HTML from code is risky
because itâ€™s easy to inadvertently expose your users to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack.

## Example code

```tsx
import {RawHtml} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

export function MyComponent() {
  return <RawHtml dangerouslySetInnerHTML="<p>Hello world</p>" />;
}
```
