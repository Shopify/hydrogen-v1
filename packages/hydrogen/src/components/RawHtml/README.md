The `RawHtml` component renders an HTML string as HTML DOM elements. This should be used for
displaying rich text-like descriptions associated with a product.

The string passed to `RawHtml` is sanitized with
[isomorphic-dompurify](https://github.com/kkomelin/isomorphic-dompurify) by default.
To keep the text unsanitized, set the `unsanitized` prop to `true`.

## Example code

```tsx
import {RawHtml} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

export function MyComponent() {
  return <RawHtml string="<p>Hello world</p>" />;
}
```
