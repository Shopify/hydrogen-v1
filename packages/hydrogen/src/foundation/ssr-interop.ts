 * Isomorphic hook to access context data. It gives access to the current request

 * components, it uses the server getter in SSR and the client fallback in the browser.
 * @param serverGetter - A function that gets the current server request and returns any
 * desired request property. It only runs in the server (both in RSC and SSR).
 * @param clientFallback - An optional raw value or a React.Context to be consumed that will be
 * returned if the current environment is not the server. Note that, if this is a React.Context,
 * there must be a React.Provider parent in the app tree.
 * @returns A value retrieved from the current server request or a fallback value in the client.
 * The returned type depends on what the server getter returns.
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import {MyClientContext} from './my-client-react-context-provider';
 * useEnvContext(req => req.ctx.myServerContext, MyClientContext)
