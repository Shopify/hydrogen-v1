## Considerations

- Consider using the `useNavigate` hook only where appropriate. Generally, you should use the [`Link`](/api/hydrogen/components/framework/link) component instead, because it provides standard browser accessibility functionality, like `cmd+click` and right-click to open.
- The `useNavigate` hook is only available in client components.
