The `ShopifyProvider` component wraps your entire app and provides support for hooks. You should place it in your app's entry point component. For example, `<App>`.

## Component type

The `ShopifyProvider` component is a shared component, which means that it renders on both the server and the client. For more information about component types, refer to [React Server Components](/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/react-server-components).

## Example code

{% codeblock file %}

```jsx
import {ShopifyProvider} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ShopifyProvider shopifyConfig={shopifyConfig}>
      {/* Routes, Pages, etc */}
    </ShopifyProvider>
  );
}
```

{% endcodeblock %}
