# Disallow using JSON.parse() in React server component code

The [prototype pollution](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/prototype-pollution/javascript/) attack targets the object prototype in Javascript, leading to logical errors or potentially executing unintended code within the system. Prototype pollution happens if the JSON string being parsed has a `__proto__` key that's merged using `Object.assign`. It can also occur if a similar deep copying library is merged with another object.

Most deep copying libraries iterate over an objectâ€™s own properties and copy the primitives recursively into their own properties that are objects. This means the properties on the supplied `__proto__` key will get copied over to the prototype, opening the door to a potential attack vector for malicious code.

## Rule details

This rule prevents using `JSON.parse` in a Hydrogen API route or server component.
