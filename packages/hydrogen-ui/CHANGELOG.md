# @shopify/hydrogen-ui-alpha

## 2022.7.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated `createStorefrontClient()`: ([#2172](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2172)) by [@frehner](https://github.com/frehner)

  - Completely remove `storefrontId`
  - Add ability to customize `contentType` on every invocation of `getPublicTokenHeaders()` and `getPrivateTokenHeaders()`
  - Fix and update TypeScript type explanations
  - Update README docs

  Also updated the README with additional docs on restarting the GraphQL server in your IDE.

* Fix storefrontId from required to optional param ([#2162](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2162)) by [@wizardlyhel](https://github.com/wizardlyhel)

- Several updates and changes: ([#2171](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2171)) by [@frehner](https://github.com/frehner)

  - Migrate `<ProductPrice />` component, and the associated tests. Also create a story file
  - Allow `<ShopifyProvider />`'s `data` prop to have more optional properties
  - Fix issue with `<MediaFile />` not being exported

* Updated the `createStorefrontClient()` helper: ([#2160](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/pull/2160)) by [@frehner](https://github.com/frehner)

  - Stopped warning on missing `storefrontId` for now
  - You can now set the default `"content-type"` by passing in `createStorefrontClient({contentType: 'json' | 'graphql' })`. Defaults to `json` (previous default was `graphql`)
  - Removed the ability to pass in the `buyerIp` when using `getPublicTokenHeaders()` as it's not used by the Storefront API

  Also updated some fields in `package.json` to improve the experience when on `npmjs.com`.
