We've simplified the built-in Hydrogen caching strategies. Instead of `CacheSeconds`, `CacheMinutes`, `CacheHours`, `CacheDays`, `CacheMonths`, and `NoStore`, there is no simply `CacheLong`, `CacheShort`, and `CacheNone`. Please remember that you can [build your own caching strategies](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/cache#build-your-own-caching-strategies).
