This guide provides information on how preloaded queries work and how to configure them in your Hydrogen app.

## How preloaded queries work

Preloaded queries allow your Hydrogen app to discover and preload nested queries within a page.

In the following diagram, none of the queries (`shopInfo`, `CollectionDetails`, `layoutContent`, or `Localization`) have been preloaded:

The `shopInfo` and `CollectionDetails` queries must finish loading before `layoutContent` can start. Subsequently, `layoutContent` must finish loading before `localization` can start. This behavior is called a request waterfall, and it can severely reduce your app performance.

Because none of these queries have dependencies, it would be ideal if they all started to load in parallel up front. This process is called preloading queries, and Hydrogen does it by default:

Preloaded queries work by storing the query fetcher for the next time the same URL is requested. The first time a route is loaded, no queries are preloaded. The second time a route is loaded, Hydrogen remembers which queries were necessary to render the same route.

### Disabling preloaded queries

By default, all cached queries are preloaded. However, not all queries should be preloaded. For example, any query that returns personalized results shouldn't be preloaded. Just like caching personalized queries, preloading personalized queries can disperse data across requests. You can disable preloaded queries by setting cache to `CacheNone` or explicitly opting out with `preload: false`:

{% codeblock %}

```js
const {data} = useShopQuery({
  query: QUERY,
  variables: {
    numCollections: 3,
  },
  cache: CacheNone(), // `CacheNone()` automatically disables preloaded queries
  preload: false,     // or you can explicitly tell the query not to preload
});
```

{% endcodeblock %}

In development mode, Hydrogen detects request waterfalls, and warns you that the query isn't preloaded:

### Routes with parameters

Preloaded queries work similarly for routes with parameters, like `Product` and `Collection`, except that each route with a different parameter has its own preloaded queries.

For example, the first time a user visits `/collections/freestyle-collection`, no queries will be preloaded. Similarly, the first time a user visits `/collections/backcountry-collection`, no queries will be preloaded. However, the second time that a user visits either route, queries will be preloaded. It's important that each route has separate preloaded queries, otherwise the results of one might show up for the results of the other.

## Preload everywhere

You can tell Hydrogen to preload a query everywhere. The `preload` property takes a Boolean value or a string. When the value is `*`, Hydrogen will preload the query for every request. This option can be helpful for menu links in your navigation, allowing you to preload a query on button click or while you animate a transition to another page:

{% codeblock %}

```js
const data = fetchSync('https://my.api.com/data.json', {
  headers: {
    accept: 'application/json',
  },
  // Preloads queries for every request
  preload: '*',
}).json();
```

{% endcodeblock %}

## Debug query timings

<h4>Experimental feature</h4>

<p>The <code>showQueryTiming</code> property is an experimental feature. As a result, functionality is subject to change. You can provide feedback on this feature by <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/issues">submitting an issue in GitHub</a>.</p>

</aside>

If you have a suspense waterfall detected, then you can log request timing information by enabling the `logger.showQueryTiming` property in your [Hydrogen configuration file](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/hydrogen-config#logger).

The [`showQueryTiming`](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/hydrogen-config#logger) property logs the timeline of when queries are being requested, resolved, and rendered. If a query is preloaded, but isn't being used, then a warning displays in the server log:

![Shows a screenshot of preloaded query warning](/assets/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/preload-query-warning.png)

If a query is being double loaded, then a warning displays in the server log. This error typically happens when the preloaded query isn't the same query as the one requested:
