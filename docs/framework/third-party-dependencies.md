title: Third-party dependencies
description: Tips and tricks for using third-party dependencies in Hydrogen apps.
---

Third-party dependencies will generally work out-of-the-box with Hydrogen. This guide describes how to install third-party dependencies, where to insert them, and offers tips for troubleshooting dependencies.

## Installation

To install third party dependencies, run the following command:

{% codeblock terminal %}

```bash?title: 'npm'
npm install <dependency>
```

```bash?title: 'Yarn'
yarn add <dependency>
```

{% endcodeblock %}

## Where to insert dependencies

Consider the following:

- If the dependency interacts with `useState` or browser APIs, then place it inside a `*.client.jsx` component. Follow the [rules of server and client components](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/react-server-components#constraints).
- If the dependency is purely client-based, and you don't need to interact with it in individual components, then you can insert it in the `<head>` element of `index.html`.
- If the dependency includes a style import from a CSS file, then you can import that in the `<head>` element of `index.html`.

## Troubleshooting dependencies

This section provides strategies for troubleshooting third-party dependencies in your Hydrogen project.

### Updating Vite dependencies

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) caches pre-bundled dependencies in `node_modules/.vite`. It re-runs the pre-bundling step if any of the following changes occur:

- The dependencies list is updated in `package.json`
- Package manager lockfiles (for example `yarn.lock`) are updated
- Any fields in `vite.config.js` are updated

You can force Vite to re-bundle dependencies by completing one of the following tasks:

- Start the dev server with the `--force` command line option
- Manually delete the `node_modules/.vite` cache directory

### Bundling third-party dependencies

When bundling third-party dependencies, you might see errors in development or production related to the incorrect bundle type being used from the package.

This happens because [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) uses a heuristic to determine whether to load a module-based import (ESM) or a CommonJS-based import (CJS). Sometimes, the heuristic chooses the wrong version, or the third-party package formats their project in an unusual way.

To fix this, you can try adding the dependency to the `optimizeDeps.include` property of your `vite.config.js` file:

{% codeblock file, filename: 'vite.config.js' %}

```js
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';
import hydrogen from '@shopify/hydrogen/plugin';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [hydrogen()],

  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['YOUR_DEPENDENCY'],
  },
});
```

{% endcodeblock %}

> Tip:
> If you find that a dependency is being optimized when it shouldn't, then you can try adding the dependency to `optimizeDeps.exclude` to see if it fixes the issue.
