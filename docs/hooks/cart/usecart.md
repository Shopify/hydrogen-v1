description: The useCart hook provides access to the cart object.
---

The `useCart` hook provides access to the cart object. It must be a descendent of a `CartProvider` component.

## Example code

```tsx
import {CartProvider, useCart} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <CartProvider>
      <CartLineItems />
    </CartProvider>
  );
}

export function CartLineItems() {
  const {lines} = useCart();

  return (
    <>
      {lines.map((line) => {
        return {
          /* your JSX*/
        };
      })}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Return value

The `useCart` hook returns an object with the following keys:
