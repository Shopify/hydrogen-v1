# Configure default entry points


> ⚠️ **Important:** [Hydrogen 2.0](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev) is out now. These archival Hydrogen 1.0 docs are provided only to assist developers during their upgrade process. Please migrate to Hydrogen 2.0 as soon as possible.


Hydrogen includes the following default entry points for your app:

- **Client entry point**: [`@shopify/hydrogen/entry-client`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/blob/main/packages/hydrogen/src/entry-client.tsx), which is included in [`index.html`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/blob/main/templates/demo-store/index.html) and used for hydration purposes
- **Server entry point**: [`App.server.jsx`](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/blob/main/templates/demo-store/src/App.server.jsx)

You can configure the default entry points for your app.
### Change the client entry point

If you need to change the client entry point, then create a new file such as `src/entry-client.jsx` with the following code and update the path in `index.html`:

```jsx
// src/entry-client.jsx

import renderHydrogen from '@shopify/hydrogen/entry-client';

const ClientWrapper = (props) => props.children;

export default renderHydrogen(ClientWrapper);
```



```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script type="module" src="/src/entry-client"></script>
```



### Change the server entry point

If you need to change the server entry point, then make the following updates in the `package.json` file:

- **Development**: Pass a `HYDROGEN_SERVER_ENTRY` environment variable to the development command.
- **Production**: Use a `--ssr` flag when building your app.

```json
// package.json

"scripts": {
  "dev": "HYDROGEN_SERVER_ENTRY=/my/path/MyApp.server vite",
  ...
  "build:server": "vite build --ssr /my/path/MyApp.server",
  ...
},
```
