Hydrogen includes a set of examples that demonstrate integrations and special use cases. This guide describes the available examples that you can explore.

## How it works

All Hydrogen examples are located in the [`/examples` directory](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/tree/main/examples/) in the `Shopify/hydrogen` repository. Each example includes ready-to-use code that you can copy and paste.

> Note:
> If you're looking for a full working implementation of a Hydrogen storefront that can be scaffolded using Shopify CLI, then refer to [Templates](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/templates).
