This guide provides information on how to configure preloaded queries in your Hydrogen app.

## Disable preloaded queries

You can disable preloaded queries in the following ways:

- Set cache to `CacheNone`
- Opting out with `preload: false`

```js
const {data} = useShopQuery({
  query: QUERY,
  variables: {
    numCollections: 3,
  },
  cache: CacheNone(), // `CacheNone()` automatically disables preloaded queries
  preload: false,     // or you can explicitly tell the query not to preload
});
```



## Preload everywhere

Supply the `preload` property with either a Boolean value or a string. When the value is `*`, Hydrogen preloads the query for every request.

```js
const data = fetchSync('https://my.api.com/data.json', {
  headers: {
    accept: 'application/json',
  },
  // Preloads queries for every request
  preload: '*',
}).json();
```
