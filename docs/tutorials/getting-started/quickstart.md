# Hydrogen quickstart


> ⚠️ **Important:** [Hydrogen 2.0](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev) is out now. These archival Hydrogen 1.0 docs are provided only to assist developers during their upgrade process. Please migrate to Hydrogen 2.0 as soon as possible.


In this quickstart, you'll create a Hydrogen app locally. [Hydrogen](/custom-storefronts/hydrogen) is a front-end web development framework used for building Shopify custom storefronts.

## Requirements

You’ve installed the following dependencies:

  - [`Yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) version 1.x or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.14.0 or higher

## Step 1: Create a Hydrogen app

You can create a Hydrogen app locally using `npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project:


    ```bash
    cd <directory>
    ```



1. Run the following command:


    ```bash?title: 'npm'
    npm init @shopify/hydrogen
    ```

    ```bash?title: 'npx'
    npx @shopify/create-hydrogen
    ```

    ```bash?title: 'pnpm'
    pnpm create @shopify/create-hydrogen
    ```

    ```bash?title: 'Yarn'
    yarn create @shopify/hydrogen
    ```



## Step 2: Choose a template

Choose a [template](/docs/tutorials/getting-started/templates) to get started building your Hydrogen storefront:

```bash

? Choose a template
> Demo Store
  Hello World
```



## Step 3: Choose a language

Choose a language to develop your Hydrogen storefront:

```bash

? Choose a language
> JavaScript
  TypeScript
```



## Step 4: Name your Hydrogen storefront

Enter a name for your Hydrogen storefront:

```bash

Name your new Hydrogen storefront
> hydrogen-app
  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
```



## Step 5: Start the development server

1. Navigate to your app's directory:


    ```bash
    cd <app-directory>
    ```



1. Start the development server:


    ```bash?title: 'npm'
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash?title: 'Yarn'
    yarn dev
    ```



    You can reach the development server at <http://localhost:3000/>.
