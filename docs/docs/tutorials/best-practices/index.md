| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| Be purpose-built | Each Hydrogen custom storefront's layout, style, and feature set should be opinionated and optimized for a specific merchant or merchant segment. Your Hydrogen custom storefront should equip merchants with an optimized set of tools to meet their needs, based on what they sell and who they sell to. |
| Offer best-in-class UX | With the growing number of Shopify stores, Hydrogen custom storefronts have the power to lead the industry and to shape ecommerce user experience patterns. Hydrogen custom storefronts should be designed with quality in mind, putting the customer first. |
| Be accessible | To provide the best experience to a wide range of customers, Hydrogen custom storefronts must be built from the ground up with accessibility best practices in mind. |
