# Hydrogen configuration


:::tip
Hydrogen 2.0 is out now. These archival Hydrogen 1.0 docs are provided only to assist developers during their upgrade process. Please [migrate to Hydrogen 2.0](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/migrate-hydrogen-remix) as soon as possible.
:::



The configuration properties for Hydrogen are located in the `hydrogen.config.js` or `hydrogen.config.ts` file at the root of your project.

This guide describes Hydrogen's configuration properties and how to change the location of the configuration file.

## Example configuration

> Note:
> In the following example, environment variables are stored in `Oxygen.env`. If you're not deploying to Oxygen, then you can choose a different storage location.

The Hydrogen configuration file contains information that's needed at runtime for routing, connecting to the Storefront API, and many other options. The following example shows a basic Hydrogen configuration file:

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

import {defineConfig} from '@shopify/hydrogen/config';

/* The `defineConfig` function is an optional utility that provides types for the configuration object. */
export default defineConfig({
  /* The routes defined by Vite's import.meta.globEager method. */
  routes: '/src/routes',
  /* The information that your app needs to connect to the Storefront API. */
  shopify: {
    /* The domain of your Shopify store */
    storeDomain: '{shop_domain}.myshopify.com',
    /* Your app's public Storefront API access token. Authenticates browser and client requests. */
    storefrontToken: Oxygen?.env?.PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN,
    /* Your app's private Storefront API server (delegate access) token. Authenticates server requests. */
    privateStorefrontToken: Oxygen?.env?.PRIVATE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN,
    /* The Storefront API version that your app uses */
    storefrontApiVersion: '2022-07',
    /* (Optional) The unique ID for the storefront. Only gets assigned by Oxygen */
    storefrontId: Oxygen?.env?.PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_ID,
  },
  /* A path to a custom page to render when the server encounters an unhandled exception */
  serverErrorPage: '/src/Error.jsx',
});
```



## Configuration properties

The following groupings of configuration properties can exist in Hydrogen:

- [`logger`](#logger)
- [`poweredByHeader`](#poweredbyheader)
- [`routes`](#routes)
- [`serverAnalyticsConnectors`](#serveranalyticsconnectors)
- [`serverErrorPage`](#servererrorpage)
- [`session`](#session)
- [`shopify`](#shopify)
- [`strictMode`](#strictmode)

### `logger`

The default behavior of the [`log` utility](/utilities/log/) maps to the global `console` object. However, you can also customize this behavior in the configuration object.

You can pass [any method](/utilities/log.md#methods) of the `log` utility in the `logger` object to override the default behavior. The first argument of each log method contains a `request` object if the log was called in the same context as a request. The following Boolean options are also available:

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  logger: {
    /* Overrides the default `log.trace` behavior. */
    trace: (request, ...args) => console.log(request.url, ...args),
    /* Overrides the default `log.error` behavior. */
    error: async (request, error) => {
      console.error(error);
      // Methods can return promises. Hydrogen won't block the current
      // request but it will wait for the promises to be returned before the runtime instance ends.
      await myErrorTrackingService.send(request, error);
    },
    /* ... */

    /* Logs the cache status of each stored entry: `PUT`, `HIT`, `MISS` or `STALE`. */
    showCacheApiStatus: true,
    /* Logs the cache control headers of the main document and its sub queries. */
    showCacheControlHeader: true,
    /* Logs the timeline of when queries are being requested, resolved, and rendered.
     * This is an experimental feature. As a result, functionality is subject to change.
     * You can provide feedback on this feature by submitting an issue in GitHub:
     * https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/issues.*/
    showQueryTiming: true,
    /* Logs warnings in your app if you're over-fetching data from the Storefront API.
     * This is an experimental feature. As a result, functionality is subject to change.
     * You can provide feedback on this feature by submitting an issue in GitHub:
     * https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/issues. */
    showUnusedQueryProperties: true,
  },
});
```



### `poweredByHeader`

By default, Hydrogen responds with the `powered-by: Shopify, Hydrogen` header. You can disable this by adding `poweredByHeader: false` to your config:

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  poweredByHeader: false,
});
```



### `routes`

The `routes` property specifies a path to find server components and API handlers. The default value for the `routes` property is `/src/routes`, but you can specify the value to any path that starts from the project root:

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  /* Path from the project root to the files for server components and API handlers */
  routes: '/path/to/routes',
});
```



If your app requires a more advanced configuration, then you can provide additional information about routes manually:

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  routes: {
    /* Path from the project root to the files for server components and API handlers */
    files: '/path/to/routes',
    /* A path that's prepended to all file routes. You can modify `basePath`
     * if you want to prefix all file routes. For example, you can prefix all file routes with a locale.
     */
    basePath: '/',
  },
});
```



### `serverAnalyticsConnectors`

The `serverAnalyticsConnectors` property allows you to [send analytics data from the server](/tutorials/analytics/index.md#analytics-sent-from-the-server-side) in your Hydrogen app. For more information about analytics support in Hydrogen, refer to [Analytics](/tutorials/analytics/index).

### `serverErrorPage`

If an unexpected error occurs while rendering a route, then Hydrogen responds with a 500 HTTP error and renders a default error page at `/src/Error.{jsx,tsx}`.

You can define a custom error page with the `serverErrorPage` configuration property. The custom error page is passed an `Error` property. The following is an example:

```tsx
// /src/Error.jsx

export default function Error({error}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>An unknown error occured!</h1>
      <h2>{error.message}</h2>
      <h3>{error.stack}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
```



> Note:
> If Hydrogen fails to render the custom error page, then it falls back to the default built-in Error page.

### `session`

The `session` property allows you to configure sessions support in your Hydrogen storefront. Learn moore about configuring [sessions support](/tutorials/sessions/) in Hydrogen storefronts.

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

import {defineConfig, CookieSessionStorage} from '@shopify/hydrogen/config';

export default defineConfig({
  /* The default session storage mechanism for Hydrogen. */
  session: CookieSessionStorage('__session', {
    /* Tells the browser that the cookie should only be sent to the server if it's within the defined path.  */
    path: '/',
    /* Whether to secure the cookie so that client-side JavaScript can't read the cookie. */
    httpOnly: true,
    /* Whether to secure the cookie so that the browser only sends the cookie over HTTPS.  */
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    /* Declares that the cookie should be restricted to a first-party or same-site context.  */
    sameSite: 'strict',
    /* The number of seconds until the cookie expires. */
    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,
  }),
});
```



### `shopify`

The `shopify` property contains all the information that your app needs to connect to the Storefront API. This configuration is passed automatically to the [`ShopifyProvider`](/components/global/shopifyprovider/) component in your app.

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  shopify: {
    /* The app's default language */
    defaultLanguage: 'EN',
    /* The app's default country */
    defaultCountry: 'US',
    /* The domain of your Shopify store */
    storeDomain: '{shop_domain}.myshopify.com',
    /* Your app's Storefront API access token */
    storefrontToken: '{storefront_api_access_token}',
    /* The Storefront API version that your app uses */
    storefrontApiVersion: '2022-07',
  },
});
```



For advanced use cases, you can provide a function that returns the same properties. For example, this approach is useful when the Storefront API connection varies depending on the domain or a subpath of the URL:

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

let myShopifyConfigCache = {};

export default defineConfig({
  shopify: (request: HydrogenRequest) => {
    // For example, you can change the configuration based on the normalized URL
    const url = new URL(request.normalizedUrl);
    const [firstUrlPart] = url.pathname.split('/');

    if (myShopifyConfigCache[firstUrlPart]) {
      // Return the cached version synchronously
      // to avoid Suspense fallback
      return myShopifyConfigCache[firstUrlPart];
    }

    // Fetch the needed information and cache it
    return fetch(`https://myApi.com/?${firstUrlPart}`)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then(({storeDomain, storefrontToken}) => {
        myShopifyConfigCache[firstUrlPart] = {
          storeDomain,
          storefrontToken,
          storefrontApiVersion: '2022-07',
        };

        return myShopifyConfigCache[firstUrlPart];
      });
  },
  // ...
};
```



The function is called inside the [`ShopifyProvider`](/components/global/shopifyprovider/) component in your app. This means that Suspense fallbacks are shown while resolving the configuration if a promise is returned.

> Tip:
> Consider caching the result of the function to speed up subsequent requests.

### `strictMode`

[Strict mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html) is enabled by default for all Hydrogen storefronts in development. It includes [strict effects](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/19), which mounts and unmounts components multiple times to catch potential issues with user or third-party code.

If strict effects cause problems for your app, then you can turn off strict mode.

```tsx
// hydrogen.config.ts

export default defineConfig({
  strictMode: false,
});
```



> Caution:
> If you turn off strict mode, then we recommended that you still include the `StrictMode` component at as high of a level as possible in your React tree to catch errors.

## Change the configuration file location
