description: The ShopifyProvider component wraps your entire app and provides support for hooks.
---

The `ShopifyProvider` component wraps your entire app and provides functionality for many components, hooks, and utilities. You should place it in your app's entry point component. If you're using the Hydrogen framework, then it should be within `App.server.jsx`.

The `ShopifyProvider` component also provides localization data for the app. The default localization data is defined within your [Hydrogen configuration file](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/hydrogen-config). You can change the active country and language at runtime by passing in the `countryCode` and `languageCode` props.

## Example code

```tsx
import {ShopifyProvider} from '@shopify/hydrogen';

export default function App() {
  return <ShopifyProvider>{/* Routes, Pages, etc */}</ShopifyProvider>;
}
```

## Component type

## Considerations

- `ShopifyProvider` is specific to Hydrogen and currently doesn't work in Next.js or other frameworks.
- You can't have multiple instances of `ShopifyProvider` within your app. Because it's not using `Context` (which isn't currently supported in server components), all `<ShopifyProvider>` instances share the same configuration for each request.
- You can dynamically define the Shopify connection information for each request to the server by providing a function in [the Hydrogen configuration file](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/hydrogen-config#shopify). This is useful for aggregating multiple storefronts with a single Hydrogen app.
