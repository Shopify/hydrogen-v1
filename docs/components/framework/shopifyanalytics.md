The `ShopifyAnalytics` component sends commerce-related analytics to Shopify. By adding the `ShopifyAnalytics` component to your Hydrogen storefront, you can view key sales, orders, and online store visitor data from the [Analytics dashboard in your Shopify admin](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/overview-dashboard).

> Note:
> Currently, only Online Store page view and session-related analytic reports can be configured with the `ShopifyAnalytics` component. Additional analytics functionality will be available in the coming weeks.

## Configuration

Add the `ShopifyAnalytics` component in `App.server.jsx`:

{% codeblock file, filename: 'App.server.jsx' %}

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingFallback />}>
      <ShopifyProvider>
        ...
        <ShopifyAnalytics />
      </ShopifyProvider>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

{% endcodeblock %}

If you have a custom domain or you're using sub-domains, then you can set the cookie domain of
the `ShopifyAnalytics` component so that cookies persists for your root domain:

{% codeblock file, filename: 'App.server.jsx' %}

```jsx
<ShopifyAnalytics cookieDomain="my-shop.com" />
```

{% endcodeblock %}

If you're not using custom domains or sub-domains, then the `ShopifyAnalytics` component uses the `storeDomain` value in the Hydrogen configuration file as the default cookie domain or leaves it blank when the specified cookie domain doesn't match `window.location.hostname`.

### Connecting Hydrogen analytics with Shopify checkout

Analytic cookies must be set at the first-party domain. This means that when a buyer navigates from your Hydrogen storefront to Shopify checkout, the domain name must stay the same.

You can achieve this by assigning a sub-domain to your online store. For example, you can do the following tasks:

- Set your Hydrogen store domain to `https://www.my-awesome-hydrogen-store.com`.
- Attach a new sub-domain to your online store at `https://checkout.my-awesome-hydrogen-store.com`.
- Set the `cookieDomain` to the same root domain at `<ShopifyAnalytics cookieDomain="my-awesome-hydrogen-store.com" />`.

> Note:
> Hydrogen analytics and Shopify checkout can only be connected in production. They can't be connected in development and preview modes.
