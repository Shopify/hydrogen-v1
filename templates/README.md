# Hydrogen templates

Hydrogen templates are complete working implementations of Shopify custom storefronts. You can automatically scaffold these storefronts with Shopify CLI.

## Demo store

```sh
## Install the Demo Store template
$ npx create-hydrogen-app --template demo-store
## Demo store is the default template
$ npx create-hydrogen-app
```

It showcases Shopify’s opinionated best practices for building storefronts with Hydrogen, and some advanced features of the framework. Pick this template to inspect a working Hydrogen codebase, or to use as a starting point for your own build.

## Hello World

```sh
## Install the Hello World template
$ npx create-hydrogen-app --template hello-world
