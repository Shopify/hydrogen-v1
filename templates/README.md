# Hydrogen templates

Hydrogen templates are complete working implementations of Shopify custom storefronts. You can automatically scaffold these storefronts with Shopify CLI.

## Hello World

```sh
## Install the Hello World template
$ npx create-hydrogen-app --template hello-world
```

**Hello World** is a minimal implementation of a Hydrogen app. It has few dependencies and very little boilerplate. Pick this template to start building from scratch.

## Demo store

```sh
## Install the Demo Store template
$ npx create-hydrogen-app --template demo-store
```

**Demo Store** is a complete Hydrogen storefront that uses live production data. It includes demonstration implementations of a homepage, product detail pages, collections, data-fetching, caching strategies, Tailwind integration, and more. It showcases Shopifyâ€™s opinionated best practices for building storefronts with Hydrogen, and some advanced features of the framework. Pick this template to inspect a working Hydrogen codebase, or to use as a starting point for your own build.
